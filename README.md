# OwezzyWeatherApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.5.


## Development server
### Pre-requisites
- Do NOT install `@angular/cli` or `typescript` globally to avoid version mismatch issues across multiple projects.
- Run `npx @angular/cli new app-name --routing` to create a new Angular app with basic routing wired.
- To run `ng` commands from within the project directory, preprend `npx` to commands, like `npx ng build`.
- To continue using `ng` without having to prepend `npx`, configure shell autofallback as described here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx#shell-auto-fallback.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
